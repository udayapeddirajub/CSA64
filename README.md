# CSA64
This repository contains the implementation of a 64-bit Carry Select Adder (CSA) using Ripple Carry Adders (RCA). The Carry Select Adder is a fast and efficient method for adding two binary numbers of significant bit lengths. 
Verilog Source Code: The repository contains the Verilog source code files that define the Carry Select Adder architecture and its components.
Testbench: A comprehensive testbench is included to verify the functionality and correctness of the implemented Carry Select Adder.
